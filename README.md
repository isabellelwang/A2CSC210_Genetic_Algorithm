Brief summary of what you observed about your genetic algorithm:
The genetic alorigthm iterates 100 times. The kth number's fitness level is often 0 or -1. Sometimes the generation becomes fitter and sometimes the generation becomes less fit. The fitness level is ranges from 2 to 4 and in evolution 3, the fitness level was 3. 

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
This assignment took shorter to complete than A1. I think the instructions were a lot clearer than A1 and I also was able to apply what I learned in class to make the algorithms. I figured out I had some bugs in my code, which yieled in the generation's chromosomes to size down to 1 rather than the max size. I also learned that it is possible to copy an arraylist to another.
